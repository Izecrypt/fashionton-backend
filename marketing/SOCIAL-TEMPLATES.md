🧵 Why FashionTON Wardrobe is about to take over 
   the TON ecosystem 👇

1/ The fashion-crypto crossover is inevitable

38% of female crypto spend goes to beauty & fashion.
Yet ZERO TON apps serve this market.

We're changing that. 👗💎

---

2/ Viral mechanics built-in

• Daily style challenges with TON prizes
• Like/vote system (Instagram familiar)
• Share outfits = social proof
• Creator tipping economy

Every feature designed to spread. 📈

---

3/ Real utility, not speculation

• Virtual wardrobe (solves real problem)
• Size calculator (saves money on returns)
• AR try-on (reduces purchase anxiety)
• TON integration (seamless payments)

Utility drives retention. 🎯

---

4/ The numbers

• Market size: $2.5T global fashion
• Target: 38% of female crypto holders
• Competition in TON: ZERO
• Timeline to launch: NOW

First mover advantage is everything. ⚡

Quick follow-up on my partnership invitation!

Our founding influencer cohort is 80% full, and I'd 
hate for you to miss out on:

Even a quick "not interested" helps me know 
where we stand.

Subject: 🎀 Your style just became valuable

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How many outfits have you 
posted this month?

Now follow-up: How much did you earn from them?

If the answer is "nothing," we need to talk.

FashionTON Wardrobe is the first app that 
actually pays you for your style.

Here's how it works:

1. Upload your wardrobe (takes 5 minutes)
2. Join daily challenges (takes 1 photo)
3. Get votes from the community
4. Win TON crypto (real money)

Yesterday's "Summer Vibes" challenge had 
a 50 TON prize pool. That's real value 
for your existing content.

PLUS: Creators can receive tips directly 
from fans. No brand deals needed.

🤖 START HERE: @FashionTONbot

As a newsletter subscriber, use code 
NEWSLETTER for 5 bonus TON on signup.
