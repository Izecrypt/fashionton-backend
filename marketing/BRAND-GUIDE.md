## 3. Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Brand Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Confident** | Bold statements, no hesitation | "Your best outfits deserve recognition" |
| **Playful** | Fun, approachable, emoji-friendly | "Dress up, earn crypto 🎉" |
| **Empowering** | Makes users feel capable | "Style is your superpower" |
| **Trendy** | Current slang, fashion/crypto aware | "That fit is fire 🔥" |
| **Inclusive** | Welcoming to all fashion levels | "Whether you're streetwear or haute couture..." |

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Launch/Announcements** | Excited, celebratory | "The future of fashion is HERE! 🚀" |
| **Tutorials** | Helpful, clear | "Here's how to upload your first piece..." |
| **Error Messages** | Empathetic, solution-focused | "Oops! Let's try that again..." |
| **Challenge Winners** | Enthusiastic, rewarding | "YOU WON! That look absolutely slayed! 🏆" |
| **Crypto Education** | Informative, accessible | "New to TON? No worries, we've got you..." |

### Writing Style Rules

1. **Use contractions** — "you're" not "you are" (conversational)
2. **Active voice** — "Earn TON" not "TON can be earned"
3. **Sentence case** for buttons — "Start challenge" not "Start Challenge"
4. **Emoji as punctuation** — Use 👗💎✨ together as brand signature
5. **Exclamation points** — Okay for enthusiasm, but don't overdo it
6. **Fashion slang welcome** — "fit check," "slay," "aesthetic," "main character energy"

### Words to Use
- Style, not just fashion
- Community, not users
- Earn, not get
- Challenges, not contests
- Wardrobe, not closet
- Creator, not influencer
- Tips, not payments

### Words to Avoid
- "Users" (use "stylists," "creators," "community")
- "Buy" (use "unlock," "upgrade," "premium")
- "Cheap" (use "accessible," "starter")
- "Easy" (implies it wasn't worth it)
- "Just" (diminishes value)
